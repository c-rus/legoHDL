legoHDL
=======

legoHDL is a simple, powerful, and flexible package manager for HDL designs. 
It provides full package management capabilities as one would expect from 
premiere software package managers like Cargo, APT, PIP, and RubyGems. 
It also provides a “plug-in” style mindset toward using custom scripted 
backend tools and workflows.
