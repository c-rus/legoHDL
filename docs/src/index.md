legoHDL is the package manager and development tool for Hardware Description Languages (HDL). The goal of this documentation is to provide materials to learn, use, and understand the legoHDL project. 

## Sections
The following documentation is mainly divided into 4 sections:
1. [Tutorials](./tutorials/tutorials.md) - step-by-step lessons working with legoHDL
2. [User Guide](./user_guide/user_guide.md) - general procedures for "how-to" solve common problems
3. [Topic Guide](./topic_guide/topic_guide.md) - explanations that clarify and provide more detail to particular topics
4. [Reference](./reference/reference.md) - technical information

## Better IP management. For All. 
legoHDL is a complete and custom open-source solution to better developing and managing HDL designs. Stop wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel, fighting with tools, and copying HDL files into new projects.

__VHDL__ and __Verilog__ are supported as well as mixed-language.

Cross-platform compatibility with __macos__, __ubuntu__, and __windows__.
