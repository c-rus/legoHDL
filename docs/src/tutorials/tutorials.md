# Tutorials

In this chapter, you will be taken through step-by-step lessons to begin working with legoHDL. 

There are multiple tutorial sections: [blocks](./tutorials.md#blocks), [vendors](./tutorials.md#vendors), [template](./tutorials.md#template), [scripts](./tutorials.md#scripts), [workspaces](./tutorials.md#workspaces), [profiles](./tutorials.md#profiles).

<!--TODO: Streamline the tutorials so they all 'flow' together down one path. -->

## Blocks
In the first tutorial, you will create your first block for the infamous full adder design. In the second tutorial, you will then make a new block containing a ripple-carry adder to use the full adder block.

## Vendors
In the first tutorial, you will create a new vendor. In the second tutorial, you will create a block for a mux design and publish it to the created vendor.

## Template
In the first tutorial, you will open the template and create a basic structure. In the second tutorial, you will use hidden files to create new files within an already created block.

## Plugins
In the first tutorial, you will open the plugins folder and design a simple plugin. In the second tutorial, you will use this plugin to build a block's design. In the third tutorial, you will create a more complex plugin to handle command-line arguments and custom labels.

## Workspaces
In the first tutorial, you will create a new workspace and switch between it and the previous workspace.

## Profiles
In the first tutorial, you will create a new profile to save a template layout. In the second tutorial, you will add settings, a plugin, and then import the existing profile.
