; --- general settings --- 
; DESCRIPTION:
; Various assignments related to the tool in general.
[GENERAL]
    key              = 10
    key2             = hello world!
    key3             = 'this is a string"; = without comments!'

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; A workspace listed under [workspace] to be in current use. If an empty
    ; assignment, a lot of functionality will be unavailable.
    ; VALUE:
    ; <workspace>
    active-workspace = eel4712c

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; Your name! (or code-name, code-names are cool too).
    ; VALUE:
    ; <name>
    author           = chase

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; How often to synchronize vendors with their remote every day. Set to -1 to
    ; refresh on every call to legoHDL. Maximum accepted value is 1440 (every
    ; minute). Evenly divides the refresh points throughout the 24-hour day.
    ; This settings is the automation of the 'refresh' command.
    ; VALUE:
    ; -1 to 1440
    refresh-rate     = 1

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; When enabled, it will reference blocks found in the workspace path over
    ; blocks found in the cache. This is beneficial for simulataneously working 
    ; on multiple related blocks. When disabled, it will only allow blocks to be
    ; used from the cache. Write 'on' to enable or 'off' to disable.
    ; VALUE:
    ; 'on' or 'off'
    multi-develop    = off

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; The command to call your preferred text editor.
    ; VALUE:

; --- vendor settings --- 
; DESCRIPTION:
; Available vendors to be linked to workspaces. A vendor allows blocks to be
; visible from remote repositories and downloaded/installed across machines. If 
; a vendor is not configured to a remote repository, its value is empty.

; --- label settings --- 
; DESCRIPTION:
; User-defined groupings of filetypes to be collected and written to the
; blueprint file during export. Labels help bridge a custom workflow with any
; plugin by adding support for additional files.
[LABEL]

    ; --- label.global settings --- 
    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; Find these files throughout all blocks used in the current design.
    ; KEYS:

; --- workspace settings --- 
; DESCRIPTION:
; User-defined spaces for working with blocks. Blocks must appear in the
; workspace's path to be recognized as downloaded. Multiple vendors can be
; configured to one workspace and vendors can be shared across workspaces. Block
; downloads and installations in one workspace are separate from those of
; another workspace.
; SECTIONS:
; [.<workspace>]
;     path = <path>
;     vendors = (<vndr0>, <vndr1>, ...)

; --- hdl-styling settings --- 
; DESCRIPTION:
; Configure how to print compatible HDL code.
[HDL-STYLING]

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; Select which HDL language (vhdl, verilog, or auto) is default to print
    ; compatible code. If 'auto' is selected, then the code is printed in the
    ; originally written language.
    ; VALUE:
    ; 'vhdl', 'verilog', or 'auto'
    default-language = auto

    ; DESCRIPTION:
    ; Determine the number of spaces (0 to 80) to proceed an identifier. Used in
    ; conjunction with the 'auto-fit' key.
    ; VALUE:
    ; 0 to 80
    alignment        = 1
