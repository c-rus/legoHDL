# _lego_**HDL**
### The simple, lightweight, powerful package manager for HDL design.
  
<br />  

_lego_**HDL** is a simple, powerful, and flexible package manager for VHDL designs. It provides full package management capabilities as one would expect from premiere software package managers like Cargo, APT, PIP, and RubyGems. Inspiration has been taken from all of these to build this tool for HDL development. 

Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.

<br />

_lego_**HDL** is available to work completely local or along with remote locations to collaborate and share blocks with others. It is designed to give the developer maximum freedom and increased productivity in their workflow.

### __Documentation__

Documentation can be found [here](https://legohdl.notion.site/legohdl/legoHDL-f798525eee2f4378bcf5e970ae6373cf). 


### __Roadmap__
The project is currently under development, and the roadmap gives a glimpse into what is being developed, with new things always being added. The overall roadmap to an initial release:

1. Finish implementing verilog support (printing instantiations, ability to have a -vhdl or -verilog flag to convert code into the proper instantiations)
2. Update documentation to correctly reflect the newest changes (new default labels) and further explain concepts behind legohdl design.

### __Trying it out__
Being under development, some things are out-of-date in the documentation as new features are added. If you still want to try some things out, you currently can:
1. clone this repository
2. run `pip install .` from within the repository's root directory
3. have fun! See the documentation website for further info on getting started.

Once the roadmap is complete for v1.0.0, users will be able to install legoHDL directly through pip from PYPI.
