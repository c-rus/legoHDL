# _lego_**HDL**
### The simple, lightweight, powerful HDL package manager and development tool.
  
<br />  

_lego_**HDL** is a simple, powerful, and flexible HDL package manager and development tool used through the command-line interface. It provides full package management capabilities as one would expect from premiere software package managers like Cargo, APT, PIP, and RubyGems and incorporates special functionality specific to HDL designing to rapidly improve development workflow.

Inspired by the modular and fun building approach of LEGO® bricks, legoHDL brings modularity and management to the HDL world by enabling designs to be built as if they are LEGO® bricks. LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse this site or this project.

Supports Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Supports VHDL and Verilog/SystemVerilog with mixed language support.

<br />

_lego_**HDL** is available to work completely local or along with remote locations to collaborate and share blocks with others. It is designed to give the developer complete customization and increased productivity in their workflow.

### __Documentation__

Documentation can be found [here](https://legohdl.notion.site/legohdl/legoHDL-f798525eee2f4378bcf5e970ae6373cf). 


### __Roadmap__
The project is currently under development, and the roadmap gives a glimpse into what is being developed with new things always being added. The overall roadmap to an initial release:

1. Finish implementing verilog support (printing instantiations, ability to have a -vhdl or -verilog flag to convert code into the proper instantiations)
2. Update documentation to correctly reflect the newest changes (new default labels) and further explain concepts behind legohdl design.

### __Trying it out__
Being under active development, some things are out-of-date in the documentation and features are constantly being changed. If you still want to try some things out, you currently can:
1. clone this repository
2. run `pip install .` from within the repository's root directory
3. have fun! See the documentation website for further info on getting started.

Once the roadmap is complete for v1.0.0, users will be able to install legoHDL directly through pip from PYPI.

### __Getting sample scripts__
Some basic, ready-to-use backend scripts are available at https://github.com/legoHDL/scripts. Use them, be inspired by them, or ignore them.

### __Quick Start__
A quick start kit (a repository containing sample backend scripts and a sample settings file) will be created soon to help users dive right in.
