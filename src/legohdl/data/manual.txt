; Description:
;   The help text for each legoHDL command. Provides the name, synopsis,
;   description, and options. Some examples for specific commands too.
; Usage:
;   All lines with ';' are skipped. Each line beginning with an '*' is evaluated
;   to see what command the following text belongs to. Reads all the way up
;   to the next '*'.
; Notes:
;   title delimiter = '.' - separates a title into subsections
;   explicit version = 'v1.0.0' or 'v1_0_0'
;   block = title in M.L.N form
;   Throughout the document, word entity is used. This is synonymous with the Verilog
;       keyword module. any reference to entity also means module. Using the word
;       entity may be replaced with a better term like: unit, part, chip 

; --- DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS ---

* new
NAME:
        new - Create a new legoHDL block (project)

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl new <block> [-open] [-remote=<url>] [-no-template]

DESCRIPTION:
        Create a new HDL project recognized by legoHDL as a "block". The block
        will be created under a new folder at the workspace's local path such
        as <workspace-path>/<block-library>/<block-name>. A git repository will be automatically
        created, and a bare git remote repository URL can be passed for
        automatic configuration. If a non-bare remote repository is passed, the
        block will not be created, but can be initialized (see 'init' command).

        When copying in the template, files hidden within a hidden directory will
        not be copied. The files a designer would place inside a hidden directory 
        may be extra files that could be initialized later on a per-block basis.

OPTIONS:
        <block>
            The project's title. A library and a name must be included, and optionally
            a market can be prepended to the title.

        -open
            Upon creating the block, open it in the configured text-editor.

        -remote=<url>
            A bare remote git repository to be attached to the created block's
            git repository.

        -no-template
            Do not copy in the configured template folder. The created block
            folder will only contain the necessary Block.cfg file.


* init
NAME:
        init - Initialize a legoHDL block (project) from existing code, block metadata, 
            or new files from the template

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl init <block> [-remote=<url>] [-market=<mkrt>] [-summary=<summary>]
        legohdl init <file> -file[=<template-file>] [-force]

DESCRIPTION:
        When the current directory or provided remote repository already is a valid legoHDL block,
        the <block> is ignored.

        When a remote repository is given and it already is a valid block (i.e. 
        the root directory contains a Block.cfg file), the <block> will be ignored 
        and the actual title will be used. This becomes an equivalent to using the 
        'download' command.

        If trying to initialize a new file and that path already exists, the
        existing file will not be overwritten unless -force is used.
        :todo:

OPTIONS:
        <block>
                :ref:

        -remote=<url>
                :ref:

        -market=<mrkt>
                Set the block's market. <market> must be a valid market available
                in the current workspace.

        -summary=<summary>
                Fill in the summary for the block's metadata. <summary> is a string
                that describes the current block.

        <file>
                The filepath to intialize a new file.

        -file[=<template-file>]
                Initialize a new file within the current block. Specifying <template-file>
                will copy the template file to the desired directory with placeholders
                correctly replaced. Omitting <template-file> will create a blank file.

        -force
                Overwrite the filepath even if it already exists when initializing a file.


* open
NAME:
        open - Use the configured text-editor to open a variety of legoHDL-related things

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl open <block>
        legohdl open [<script-alias>] -script
        legohdl open <profile-name> -profile
        legohdl open (-template | -settings[=<mode>])

DESCRIPTION:
        :todo:

OPTIONS:
        <block>
                :ref:

        <script-alias>
            The alias for the saved custom script within legoHDL. It is a user-defined
            key in settings under "scripts". If the alias's value is a command that 
            references a real existing file, that file will be opened.

        -script
            The flag to indicate a script is trying to be opened. If no <script-alias>
            value is given with this flag, the built-in scripts folder will be
            opened.

        <profile-name>
            The profile configuration name stored within legoHDL settings. When valid,
            that profile directory will open.

        -profile
            The flag to indicate a profile is trying to be opened.

        -template
            The flag to indicate the template is trying to be opened. If the
            configured template value in settings is blank, the built-in template
            folder will be opened.
        
        -settings[=<mode>]
            The flag to indicate the settings is trying to be opened.

            <mode> determines how to open the settings. Accepted values are gui and file. 
            When omitted, the default is to open the settings in gui mode.

* port
NAME:
        port - Print the compatible code for the ports list of a specified entity

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl port [<block>:]<entity> [-comp[=<lang>] | -inst[=<lang>]] [-arch] [-about]

DESCRIPTION:
        When trying to access current block-level entities, the <block>
        can be omitted (a form of shortcutting). To reference a entity,
        <market>.<library>.<name>(<version>):<entity>.

        By default, it will print the about section and the component declaration for
        VHDL entities or the module interface for Verilog modules.

OPTIONS:
        <block>
                The block's title. If omitted, the <entity> is searched for only
                within the current block's scope.

        <entity>
                The design unit name.

        -comp[=<lang>]
                Print the component instantation. This includes the component declaration,
                relevant constants for each generic, relevant signals for each port,
                and the component instantiation. For Verilog form, the module interface
                is printed instead of a component declaration.

                <lang> specifies what HDL language to use to print the formatted code. 
                Accepted values are vlog and vhdl. Omitting <lang> prints the code in 
                the entity's original language.

        -inst[=<lang>]
                Print the direct entity instantiation (VHDL-93 feature). This includes
                relevant constants for each generic, relevant signals for each port,
                and the direct entity instantiation. 
                
                <lang> specifies what HDL language to use to print the formatted code. 
                Accepted values are vlog and vhdl. Omitting <lang> prints the code in 
                the entity's original language.

        -arch
                List the available architectures. If the entity is a Verilog
                module, only "rtl" will be listed.

        -about
                Print the comment header block found at the beginning of this
                entity's file (if exists). Helpful to read more information
                about an entity and how it behaves. Also prints various statistics
                regarding the entity.


* graph
NAME:
        graph - Visualize the dependency tree for the design

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl graph [<entity>] [-tb=<tb>] [-ignore-tb]

DESCRIPTION:
        Create and view the dependency tree for the current block design. This 
        command is provided as a guide to quickly help the designer see how the
        design unfolds.

        When no <entity> is given, the top-level will be auto-detected and the user
        will be prompted to select one if multiple exist. When -ignore-tb and -tb=<tb>
        are absent, the testbench for the top-level entity will be auto-detected,
        if one exists. The user will be prompted to select one if multiple exist.

OPTIONS:
        <entity>
                The design unit to request as top-level.

        -tb=<tb>
                The relevant testbench file to explicitly include in the dependency
                tree. Has higher precedence of -ignore-tb.
        
        -ignore-tb
                Do not include any testbench unit in the dependency tree.

* export
NAME:
        export - Generate a blueprint file

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl export [<entity>] [-tb=<tb>] [-ignore-tb] [-quiet] [-no-clean]

DESCRIPTION:
        :todo:

OPTIONS:
        <entity>
                The design unit to request as top-level. All relevant HDL files will stem
                from this entity's file.
        
        -tb=<tb>
                Explicitly request what top-level simulation file to include in the blueprint.
                
        -ignore-tb
                Do not include a testbench file in the blueprint.

        -quiet
                Do not print intermediate information while the blueprint file is being
                created.

        -no-clean
                Do not delete the build/ directory when writing the blueprint.

* build
NAME:
        build - Execute a custom backend script/tool command

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl build +<script-alias> [<script-args...>]

DESCRIPTION:
        :todo:

OPTIONS:
        <script-alias>
                The alias for the saved custom script within legoHDL. It will execute the
                command as if it was called through the terminal.

        <script-args...>
                Any additonal arguments to pass directly to the called command. All
                arguments after <script-alias> will be passed to the executed command.


; RUN WILL BE REMOVED.
* run 
NAME:

SYNOPSIS:

DESCRIPTION:

OPTIONS:


; notes: -soft may be removed because even if a version doesn't get integrated,
;       the tag will still live on and eventually get picked up by legohdl.
* release
NAME:
        release -

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl release <version> [-msg=<msg>] [-strict] [-soft] [-dry-run]

DESCRIPTION:
        :todo:

OPTIONS:
        <version>
                The next version for the current block. The value must be either
                major, minor, patch, or an explicit version.

        -msg=<msg>
                The message to commit with. The value for <msg> is a string and if 
                the string includes spaces then quotes must encapsulate <msg>. 
                The default message is: 

        -strict
                Only adds and commits the modified changelog (if exists) and the
                Block.cfg file. All other uncommitted changes will not be in
                the following release.

        -soft
                When uploading the new version to a market, -soft will not 
                commit to the market's master branch but rather create a separate
                branch just for this release with the name <library>.<block>-<version>.
                Helpful for when a block should undergo code review.
        
        -dry-run
                Perform the complete release process as-if the block was to be
                released, but leaves the block unmodified and unreleased.

* list
NAME:
        list - View a variety of legoHDL-related things

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl list [<search>] [-entity] [-alpha] [-install] [-download]
        legohdl list [-script | -label | -market | -workspace | -profile | -template]

DESCRIPTION:
        :todo:

OPTIONS:
        <search>
                Optional field to narrow the given list by. Each subsection of a 
                block's title can be omitted. With each additionally provided title delimiter,
                the values shift left to the next subsection. See EXAMPLES for more information.

        -entity
                Instead of listing blocks, list the entities.

        -alpha
                Organize the list in alphabetical order.

        -install
                Filter only installed blocks or entities.

        -download
                Filter only downloaded blocks or entities.
        
        -script
                Return the list of scripts. Fields are alias and command.

        -label
                Return the list of labels. Fields are label, extensions,
                and recursive.
        
        -market
                Return the list of markets. Fields a are market, remote repository,
                block count, and active.
        
        -workspace
                Return the list of workspaces. Fields are workspace, active, path,
                and markets.

        -profile
                Return the list of profiles. Fields are profile, last import, legohdl.cfg,
                template/, and scripts/.

        -template
                Return the list of all availble files from the current template. These
                files can be referenced exactly as listed when initializing a new file
                with the 'init' command.

EXAMPLES:
        legohdl list lab0
                Since a market is omitted and a library is omitted, all block's starting with "lab0"
                in their name are returned.

        legohdl list eel4712c.  
                Since a market is omitted and a name is omitted, all block's starting with "eel4712c"
                in their library are returned.

        legohdl list uf-ece..
                Since a library is omitted and a name is omitted, all block's starting with "uf-ece"
                in their market are returned.

        legohdl list ..:mux_2x1 -entity
                All M.L.N subsections are blank, so the entire database is searched to see if
                an entity exists with the name mux_2x1.
