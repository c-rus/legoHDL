NAME:
        new - Create a new legoHDL block (project)

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl new <block> [-open] [-remote=<url>] [-no-template]

DESCRIPTION:
        Create a new HDL project recognized by legoHDL as a "block". The block
        will be created under a new folder at the workspace's local path such
        as <workspace-path>/<library>/<block>. A git repository will be automatically
        created, and a bare git remote repository URL can be passed for
        automatic configuration. If a non-bare remote repository is passed, the
        block will not be created, but can be initialized (see 'init' command).

OPTIONS:
        <block>
            The project's title. Follows the format of M.L.N (similiar to Xilinx's
            VLN of VLNV). The M (market) is optional.

        -open
            Upon creating the block, open it in the configured text-editor.

        -remote=<url>
            A bare remote git repository to be attached to the created block's
            git repository.

        -no-template
            Do not copy in the configured template folder. The created block
            folder will only contain the necessary Block.cfg file.

* init
NAME:
        init - Initialize a legoHDL block (project) from existing code, block metadata, 
            or new files from the template

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl init [<market>.].<library>.<block>

DESCRIPTION:


OPTIONS:

* open
NAME:
        open - Use the configured text-editor to open a variety of legoHDL-related things

SYNOPSIS:
        legohdl open <block>
        legohdl open [<script-alias>] -script
        legohdl open <profile-name> -profile
        legohdl open (-template | (-settings [-file]))

DESCRIPTION:


OPTIONS:
        <block>


        <script-alias>
            The alias for the saved custom script within legoHDL. It is a user-defined
            key in settings under "scripts". If the alias's value is a command that 
            references a real existing file, that file will be opened.

        -script
            The flag to indicate a script is trying to be opened. If no <script-alias>
            value is given with this flag, the built-in scripts folder will be
            opened.

        <profile-name>
            The profile configuration name stored within legoHDL settings. When valid,
            that profile directory will open.

        -profile
            The flag to indicate a profile is trying to be opened.

        -template
            The flag to indicate the template is trying to be opened. If the
            configured template value in settings is blank, the built-in template
            folder will be opened.
        
        -settings
            The flag to indicate the settings is trying to be opened. The settings
            are default to open in GUI mode for easy editing. However, the literal 
            settings.cfg file can be opened in the text editor when -file is raised
            too.

        -file
            The flag to indicate that the settings should open in the text-editor
            and not in GUI mode.

* port
NAME:
        port -

SYNOPSIS:

DESCRIPTION:
        When trying to access current block-level entities, the block title
        can be omitted (a form of shortcutting). To reference a entity,
        "market.library.block(version):entity".
