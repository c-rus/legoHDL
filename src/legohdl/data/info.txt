; Description:
;   The informational text used in file comments, the gui, and other various
;   things where lots of text is required.
; Usage:
;   All lines with ';' are skipped. Each line beginning with an '*' is evaluated
;   to see what key the following text belongs to. Reads all the way up
;   to the next '*'. Use a '\' to carry same text onto next line without a newline
; Notes:
;   title delimiter = '.' - separates a title into subsections
;   explicit version = 'v1.0.0' or 'v1_0_0'
;   block = title in M.L.N form
;   Throughout the document, word entity/unit is used. This is synonymous with 
;   the Verilog keyword module. any reference to entity also means module. Using
;   the word entity may be replaced with a better term like: unit, part, chip.
